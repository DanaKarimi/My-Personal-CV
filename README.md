# Running the Django Project Locally  

Follow these steps to run the Django project locally on your machine.  

## Prerequisites  

Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). It's also recommended to use a virtual environment for Python projects.  
Make sure Django is installed in your virtual environment. If it's missing from requirements.txt, install it by running:
pip install django  

## Steps to Run the Project  

# On Windows
my_env\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux
source my_env/bin/activate

# Navigate to the Main Project Directory
Ensure you are still in the directory where the manage.py file is located.

# Run the Django Development Server
python manage.py runserver  

# Stopping the Server
To stop the server, go back to your command prompt or terminal window where the server is running and press CTRL + C.
